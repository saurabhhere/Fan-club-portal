# Fan Club Portal
### About
With not much to do amidst the lockdown, most of us have sought solace in Movies and web-series. And many times, some character (be it real or fictitious) catches our eye, and we cannot help but become their die-hard fans. Fan Club Portal is for every loyal fan out there. In this App, Users can create a chat room for any movie/series they like which can be followed by other fans logged into the portal.


### Key inclusions:
- Authentication is must for each user.
- Authentication using JWT and Google OAuth both are added.
- Email verification is must to activate the account (when JWT authentication is used i.e. using sign up form).
